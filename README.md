A demo app to show WebRTC concepts. It only communicates within one browser, so it is not actually functional. It contains a basic proof-of-concept variation (index.html) and one with sound transmission (might cause a feedback loop) and interaction buttons (index_komplett.html).

This tutorial project was started by Herbert Braun and featured in c't Magazin 19/2013. More information: www.woerter.de/textverzeichnis/#filter/id=157 (in German).

Comments and variable names are in German. I'll gladly translate them if there is demand.
